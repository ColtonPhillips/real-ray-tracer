Real time ray tracer: 
====================

Features:
-High quality code style and documentation
-Highly optimized code
-Reflection, with arbitrary level of depth
-Shadows
-Multiple Light sources, movable in real time
-Movable camera
-Tweakable UI settings for depth, resolution, near field distance
-Spheres are under effect of gravity. Everything is movable. Real time!
-"Explode" feature is fun!
-Interactive Camera
-You can move the lights around real time with a slider bar
-You can add spheres to the scene by pressing the space bar
-You can move around with the arrow keys.
-You can elevate and go down using the ctrl and alt keys
-You will always be facing the origin of the scene so 
 a look_at is implemented 
-Multisampling 
(press A key to turn off and on antialiasing)
- S key will take a HIGHRESOLUTION screenshot and save in the build folder 
- Scene is rendered realistically inside a twinkling outer space
- Reflective surfaces through high ray depth
- Rudimentary accelleration scheme using C++ advanced techniques!
  (basic principle is to avoid creating objects when we don't have to and instead
   hold onto them inside of classes and reuse that object over and over)

No need to benchmark it's a real time beauty! :D
